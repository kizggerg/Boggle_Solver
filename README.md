# Boggle_Solver
This application takes a boggle board and computes a list of all possible solutions from the board.

The application is successful aside from the following exceptions:
- In the game of Boggle, 'q' is interpretted as 'qu'. This functionality is not yet added.
- The code which gathers input from the user is not incredibly robust.

The code will also require commenting for clarity, and a potential update on the user interface if time permits.
